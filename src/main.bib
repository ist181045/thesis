Combining them in the same process is not always a successful endeavor. A more effective portability mechanism is needed, and Algorithmic Design (AD) has the potential to become one. This paper explores the advantages of the algorithmic approach to the design process, and proposes a methodology capable of integrating the different tools and paradigms currently used in architecture. The methodology is based on the development of a computer program that describes not only the intended model, but also additional tasks, such as the required analysis and rendering. It takes advantage of CAD, BIM and analysis tools, with little effort when it comes to the transition between them.}

Although a relatively new field, CLP has progressed in several quite different directions. In particular, the early fundamental concepts have been adapted to better serve in different areas of applications. In this survey of CLP, a primary goal is to give a systematic description of the major trends in terms of common fundamental concepts. The three main parts cover the theory, implementation issues, and programming for applications.}
