\subsection{Visual Programming Scalability}%
\label{sec:related.ad.vpl-scalability}

The visual approach followed by both Dynamo and Grasshopper suffers from
disproportionate scalability issues between the code and the respective model's
complexity~\cite{Leitao:2013:PESLGD}.  Sophisticated modeling workflows tend to
become difficult to create, and harder for a human to understand when compared
to a textual approach.

As an example, consider the Irina Viner-Usmanova \ac{RGC}, a project developed
by TPO Pride.\footnote{\url{http://prideproject.pro}}  The \ac{RGC}, built in
Moscow's Luzhniki Olympic Complex, is an arena that houses training sessions and
competitions while also comprising several other premises.
\Cref{fig:related.ad.vpl-scalability.rgc} depicts an outside view of the
\ac{RGC} and its prominent overarching roof covering.  The roof covering was
designed using a combination of Rhino3D and Grasshopper.  Grasshopper was used
from a conceptual stage all the way through to production of construction
drawings.

\end{figure}

Developing a roof covering with such a contour lends itself well to \ac{AD}
since it resembles a sine wave whose amplitude is progressively dampened along
the length of the building.  Such a shape can be easily described through a
relatively simple mathematical function to obtain the general wave's shape.
With parametrization in mind, one could then easily fluctuate input variables in
order to achieve different variations of the roof covering's shape, e.g.,
varying the wave's frequency, amplitude, or dampening rate.

Such complex \ac{AD} projects tend to require complex \ac{AD} programs that
become overly difficult to develop and understand with \acp{VPL}.  The final
Grasshopper definition of the \ac{RGC}'s roof covering can be seen in
\cref{fig:related.ad.vpl-scalability.rgc-gh}.  This further reinforces the
statement that complex workflows become exponentially difficult to comprehend
due to the added dimensionality of the constructs used in \acp{VPL}.  This
disadvantage, however, is mitigated with their \ac{TPL} counterparts which,
despite project complexity, scale relatively better than \acp{VPL} on account of
abstraction mechanisms.
