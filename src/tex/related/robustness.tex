\subsection{Robustness}%
\label{sec:related.robustness}

The correctness proofs of most all geometric algorithms presented in theoretical
papers assumes exact computation with real numbers~\cite{CGAL:4.13:23LGK}.
However, floating-point numbers are represented with fixed precision in
computers, which leads to inaccurate representations of real number.  Typically,
comparisons must be performed relying on tolerances, i.e., two floating-point
numbers $a$ and $b$ are considered ``the same'' if $|a - b| \le \epsilon$ for a
given $\epsilon$.

When used without care, fixed-precision arithmetic almost always leads to
unwanted results due to marginal error accumulation caused by rounding
(roundoff).  To help solve this problem, more robust numerical constructs and
concepts can be used.  In particular, exact numbers, such as rational numbers or
arbitrary precision numbers. The latter allow arbitrary-precision arithmetic
with the drawback that operations are slower, however mitigating precision
issues.

Several libraries already strive to implement robust geometric computation.  One
such example is \ac{CGAL}~\cite{CGAL:5.3:Project}.  Moreover, other libraries,
such as \ac{LEDA}~\cite{Mehlhorn:1989:LEDA}, and
CORE~\cite{Karamcheti:1999:CLRNGC} and its successor~\cite{Yu:2010:CORE2}, can
also be leveraged to deal with robustness problems in geometric computation.
