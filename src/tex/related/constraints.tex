\section{\acl{GC} Tools}%
\label{sec:related.constraints}

Constraint-based programming comes in a wide variety of ways, following a
diverse set of programming paradigms, using different approaches to problem
solving briefly detailed in~\cref{sec:intro.constraints}.  Some of them also
support an associative programming model, such as
DesignScript~\cite{Aish:2011:DesignScript}, further discussed in
\cref{sec:related.ad.dynamo}, allowing for the propagation of changes made to a
variable to others that depended on the former.

\Cref{tab:related.constraints.summary} succinctly analyzes tools capable of
solving geometric constraints.  From this table, Eukleides, GeoSolver, and the
\acs{TikZ} \& \acs{PGF} system are further discussed: Eukleides for its elegant
declarative language, similar to some of the languages outlined in
\cref{tab:related.ad.summary}; GeoSolver for its helpful analysis \ac{GUI},
along with the fact it is implemented in Python, a well established and easy to
use language, already used in some competence in \ac{CAD} software (see
\cref{tab:related.ad.summary}); and \acs{TikZ} for its wide support,
development, usage, and collection of packages that extend it, enabling the
specification of graphics and geometry in a variety of simple distinct ways.

\subsection{Eukleides}%
\label{sec:related.constraints.eukleides}

Devoted to elementary plane geometry, Eukleides is a simple, full-featured, and
mainly declarative programming language, capable of handling basic data types,
such as numbers and strings, and most importantly, geometric data types, such as
points, vectors, lines, and circles.  Like most languages, it provides control
flow structures, allows user functions and module definitions, making it easily
extendable.

Eukleides provides a wide variety of functions and constructions that easily
allow the user to specify geometric constraints between objects, as demonstrated
by \cref{lst:intro.example.parallel.euk,lst:intro.example.circumcenter.euk}.
Among the listed ones, it includes functions to build parallel and perpendicular
lines with respect to another line or segment, determine a line's bisector,
tangent lines to a circle, shape intersection, and so on.  It can generate
\ac{EPS} files or produce macros, enabling the embedding of Eukleides figures in
\LaTeX{} documents.

Alas, the lack of 3D geometry support arguably constitutes Eukleides' primary
disadvantage.  It is also a \ac{TPL}, which means that, while being a very
simple language, it is less intuitive than a \ac{VPL}.  The first version of
Eukleides included a \ac{GUI}, \texttt{xeukleides}, but one is not yet available
for the current version.

Additionally, it has not seen any development for the last decade, while
\acs{TikZ} is still being actively maintained.  The latter still dominates
diagram and graphic production in \LaTeX{} documents, some
people\footnote{\url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/208412/178614}} going as
far as suggesting opting for it instead of using the former.

\subsection{GeoSolver}% 
\label{sec:related.constraints.geosolver}

GeoSolver is an open-source Python package that provides classes and functions
for specifying, analyzing, and solving geometric constraint problems.  It
features a set of 3D geometric constraint problems consisting of point
variables, two-point distance and three-point angle constraints.  Problems with
other geometric variables can be mapped to these basic constraints on point
variables.

The solutions found by GeoSolver are generic and parametric, and can be used to
derive specific solutions.  Since generic solutions are exponentially hard to
find, GeoSolver also allows different ways of  reducing the number of solutions
that would be generated, consequently reducing computation time.  In order to
efficiently find a solution, GeoSolver employs a cluster rewriting-based
approach described in~\cite{Van:2009:NRCRASSGC}, capable of handling non-rigid
clusters contrasting with typical graph constructive-based approaches.

A \ac{GUI} interactive tool called \ac{GCS} Workbench~\cite{DeRegt:2008:WGCS}
(see \cref{fig:related.constraints.geosolver.gcs}) is distributed along with the
GeoSolver package.  With it, the user can easily edit, analyze and solve
geometric constraint problems.  The latter features are obviously supported by
GeoSolver, and 3D interactivity is supported via additional libraries, such as
pyQt and pyOpenGL\@.  Although an excellent tool for understanding how a
geometric constraint problem is decomposed in GeoSolver, \ac{GCS} Workbench is
not efficient for complex design tasks when compared with its programmatic
supporting package.

      \item a prototyping pane, destined for constraint analysis and edition.

\subsection{TikZ \& PGF}%
\label{sec:related.constraints.tikz}

Originally a small \LaTeX{} style created by Till Tantau for his Ph.D.\ thesis,
\acs{TikZ}~\cite{Tantau:2021:TikZ}, along with its underlying lower-level
\ac{PGF} system, is a fully featured graphics language, basically consisting of
a series of \TeX{} commands that draw graphics.  \acs{TikZ} stands for
``\aclu{TikZ}\label{acro:TikZ}'', a recursive acronym, which translates to
``\ac{TikZ} is no drawing program''.  As mentioned, the user instead
programmatically describes their drawings.

On its own, \ac{TikZ} already includes a series of commands capable of handling
geometric constraints, such as tangency, perpendicularity, intersection; but may
appear daunting to the user in its raw form.  Several packages have been built
on top of it to facilitate the generation of drawings using a simpler syntax,
such as \texttt{tkz-2d} and its successor
\texttt{tkz-euclide}\footnote{\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/tkz-euclide}}.  The
package \texttt{tkz-euclide} was designed for easy access to the programming of
Euclidean geometry using a Cartesian coordinate system with \ac{TikZ}.  It was
used to produce \cref{fig:intro.example} with the respective code listed in
\cref{lst:intro.example.parallel.tikz,lst:intro.example.circumcenter.tikz}.

Like Eukleides, an obvious limitation they share is the lack for 3D modeling
support.  Unlike it, a plethora of resources and usage examples exist, along
with an immense amount of packages that layer on top of it for a panoply of
diverse use cases.  It still undoubtedly remains the go-to graphics system
within the \TeX{} typesetting community.  However, again comparing it to
Eukleides, even using something as \texttt{tkz-euclide}, it can look
syntactically appalling, even for the adept \TeX{} user, instead of following a
simpler and established familiar syntax akin to other declarative or imperative
programming languages.
