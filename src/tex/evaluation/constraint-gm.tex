\section{ConstraintGM}%
\label{sec:eval.cgm}

ConstraintGM is a domain-specific language developed with the shared goal of
tackling \ac{GC} problem specification using a \ac{TPL} (Racket, to be precise).
This solution heavily and blindly relied on Maxima~\cite{Maxima:2021:Maxima}, a
generic \ac{CAS} to solve \ac{GC} problems.  Geometric entities were serialized
into their algebraic equation representation coupled with the problem's
constraints and sent to Maxima.  Maxima would then attempt to solve the system
of equations and return a result that was parsed and sent back to Racket.

This approach came at a severe performance cost, the reason being two-fold:
\begin{enumerate*}[label= (\arabic*)]
  \item the communication between ConstraintGM and Maxima was slow, and
  \item Maxima is a \emph{generic} solver and could not take advantage of the
  geometric characteristics of the problem at hand.
\end{enumerate*}
The considerable performance penalty of this approach are hard to justify in the
case of simple geometric problems for which there are well-known efficient
solutions. This lead to an \textit{impromptu} implementation of some \ac{GC}
problem solutions, creating the \ac{GFL}. As expected, the latter approach
revealed that contextually specialized solutions had much better performance
than relying on a generic solver.

It is worth noting that relying on Maxima meant ConstraintGM was intrinsically
exact and robust since symbolic \ac{GCS} methods, used by Maxima, automatically
provide those features.  The \ac{GFL}, when compared to the Maxima-based
approach, is more fragile in that regard because it will depend on the
underlying constructs' number type.  If an exact arbitrary precision number type
is used, exactness and robustness will be preserved, but at a performance cost
since arbitrary precision arithmetic is computationally heavy.  Relying on
inexact number types can eventually lead to erroneous results if one is not
careful to avoid error-inducing computations, but, by contrast, offers better
performance.  That said, some computations are unavoidable, such as the
computation of the squared root, for example, when the effective distance is
necessary to operate with.  In the end, it is a matter of making a compromise
and evaluating which fits the case at end the best.

The project's benchmark involve three different \ac{GC} problems focused around
object intersection, namely
\begin{enumerate*}[label= (\arabic*)]
  \item line-line intersection,
  \item circle-line intersection, and
  \item circle-circle intersection.
\end{enumerate*}
These problems expanded into thirteen different scenarios that consisted of
rearranging the geometric entities' disposition in order to evaluate the
intersection operation's results and measure each individual scenario's
performance.

We measured real execution time instead of \ac{CPU} time both for ConstraintGM
and for our solution.  We ran ConstraintGM's benchmarks a total of nine times to
obtain a relatively decent sample of results, while our solution's benchmarks
were aided by \texttt{BenchmarkTools.jl}~\cite{Chen:2016:BenchmarkTools.jl}, a
package that considerably facilitates benchmarking Julia code.  The source code
used to benchmark both ConstraintGM and our solution is listed in
\cref{lst:appendix.cgm.bench.rkt,lst:appendix.cgm.bench.jl} respectively.  The
benchmark's results are gathered in \cref{tab:eval.cgm.perf}.  To facilitate
comprehension, these are also plotted in \cref{fig:eval.cgm.perf}.

Observing the results, we can see the disparity between the approach reliant on
Maxima when compared to both the \ac{GFL} and our solution, which was to be
expected.  Even so, amidst relatively consistent results, scenario 13 made
Maxima slug more than usual.  That scenario consists of two circles intersecting
at two different points, illustrated in \cref{fig:eval.cgm.perf.13}.  It is not
the only scenario of the set that involves two circles that intersect.  However,
this is the one that produces relatively more complex results, which could
justify why Maxima took relatively longer to compute the solution than it did
for the scenarios that preceded this one.

Analyzing the results further, we can see our solution also outdoes
ConstraintGM's \ac{GFL} by a significant margin.  This is most likely due to the
fact that we are relying on \ac{CGAL}, a library implemented in C++.  The latter
is notoriously known for being a high-performance language, considerably
outperforming Racket in a series of benchmarks.  Nevertheless, despite some
overhead in the case of Julia, the results are still positive.

In conclusion, our solution proves capable and performant, having surpassed
ConstraintGM's \ac{GFL} by an entire order of magnitude on average.
