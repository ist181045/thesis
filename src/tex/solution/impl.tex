\subsection{Implementation}%
\label{sec:solution.impl}

This section details implementation choices regarding the chosen platforms for
realizing the proposed solution.  We expand specifically on the concrete
components corresponding to the ones within \cref{fig:solution.arch}'s light
blue rectangle.

The \ac{AD} tool we have chosen was
Khepri\footnote{\url{https://github.com/aptmcl/Khepri.jl}}~\cite{Leitao:2019:GRUGEAV},
a text-based tool written in the Julia programming
language~\cite{Bezanson:2017:JAFANC}.  It follows that the \primitives{} were
implemented in the Julia language as well, supported by an \geomlibrary{}.  The
library chosen for the effect was \ac{CGAL}~\cite{CGAL:5.3:Project}, a highly
performant library written in the C++ programming
language~\cite{Stroustrup:2013:CPP}.

We need to make \ac{CGAL} available to the Julia language.  Fortunately, the
Julia language already possesses \ac{FFI} facilities that allow it to invoke
functionality within C~\cite{Kernighan:1988:C} or
Fortran~\cite{Backus:1957:Fortran} libraries.  This mechanism can be built upon
to interface with C++.

Overcoming the language interoperability hurdle, we can focus on the
\primitives{}.  These primitives build on top of the functionality available in
\ac{CGAL}, some of which is directly inherited from it.  We further enriched the
pool with a few more functions, illustrating a constructive approach to
\ac{GCS}, similar and inspired by the approach of \texttt{tkz-euclide}.
