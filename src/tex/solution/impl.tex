\section{Implementation}%
\label{sec:solution.impl}

This section details implementation choices with regard to the chosen platforms
for realizing the initially proposed general solution architecture, previously
illustrated in \cref{fig:solution.arch}. Following a brief analysis, we expand
specifically on the concrete components corresponding to the ones within
\cref{fig:solution.arch}'s light blue rectangle.

Examining the \ac{AD} workflow portion of \cref{fig:solution.arch}, there are
depictions of \ac{CAD}, \ac{BIM}, and analysis tools, of which examples could be
Rhinoceros3D, Autodesk's Revit, and Radiance, respectively, with no particular
focus on any of them.  Digging a layer deeper, we find the \ac{AD} tool, which,
by means made available by the tools above it, produces models specific to those
tools from a description provided by the user.  The \ac{AD} tool we've chosen
was Khepri~\cite{Leitao:2018:Khepri.jl,Leitao:2019:GRUGEAV}, a text-based tool
written in the Julia programming language~\cite{Bezanson:2017:JAFANC}.  Khepri
is the successor of another text-based \ac{AD} tool named
Rosetta~\cite{Leitao:2011:PGDCAD}, a tool written in the Racket programming
language~\cite{PLT:2010:Reference}.  It follows that the \textit{Geometric
Constraint Primitives} were implemented in the Julia language as well, supported
by an \textit{Exact Computation Geometry Library}.  The library chosen for the
effect was the \acf{CGAL}~\cite{CGAL:2018}, a highly performant and robust
geometric library written in the C++ programming
language~\cite{Stroustrup:2013:CPP}.

This language disparity between the \textit{Geometric Constraint Primitives}
module and the \textit{Exact Computation Geometry Library} requires a solution
for language interoperation.  In other words, we need to make \ac{CGAL}
available to the Julia language.  Fortunately, the Julia language already
possesses facilities that allow it to invoke functionality within libraries
written in the C~\cite{Kernighan:1988:C} or the
Fortran~\cite{Backus:1957:Fortran} programming languages.  This interfacing
mechanism is commonly known as \ac{FFI}.  It allows for the repurposing of
mature software libraries in foreign languages without the need for a complete
rewrite or adaptation.\footnote{The decision to include such a mechanism at the
language's core by the language designers makes it so that the language can
rapidly evolve. As such, one can avoid reimplementing several facilities and
software libraries in, but not limited to, scientific and numerical computing
areas.  Arguably, it may be one of \textit{the} fundamental features that made
the language as popular as it is and kept it afloat, unlike other similar
historical examples that might have lacked such a mechanism.}  This mechanism
can also in turn be leveraged and built upon to interface with other programming
languages, e.g., Java, Python, MATLAB, and, C++.\footnote{There is an entire
GitHub organization with projects dedicated to foreign language interoperation
at \url{https://github.com/JuliaInterop} (July 8, 2021)}

Overcoming the language interoperability hurdle, we can now start focusing on
the implementation of the \textit{Geometric Constraint Primitives}.  These
primitives build on top of the functionality available in \ac{CGAL}, some of
which is directly inherited from it, substantially helping us in the process,
e.g., intersections.  We further enriched the pool with a few more functions,
illustrating a constructive approach to \ac{GCS}, similar and inspired by the
approach of \texttt{tkz-euclide} mentioned in
\cref{sec:related.constraints.tikz}.  By creating an abstraction over more
primitive functionality, we aimed to provide an easy to understand and utilize
set of tools so that users can avoid reimplementing it themselves, which is an
error-prone process.  Furthermore, we level the playing field by working at a
conceptual level which is more familiar to and understood by traditional
\ac{CAD} software users rather than falling back to the more analytic approach
programming languages naturally offer.

The following sections will elaborate further on the components emphasized in
the previous paragraphs, adopting a bottom-up-like approach.  We will discuss
\ac{CGAL} and what constructs and functionality it can provide to aid our goal,
as well as some added benefits of building on top of a very mature and
comprehensive library.  That will be followed by a section detailing how it was
possible to map said functionality to the Julia language, of which the result
was a Julia package aptly named \texttt{CGAL.jl}\footnote{Packages in the Julia
ecosystem are conventionally terminated with a \texttt{.jl} suffix, the
extension used for Julia files.  This is reminiscent of a familiar convention
followed in the Java ecosystem where libraries and tools are usually prefixed
with the letter \texttt{J}, e.g., \texttt{JUnit}, \texttt{JMeter},
\texttt{JDeveloper}, among others.}~\cite{Ventura:2019:CGAL.jl}.  Finally, we
showcase how we leveraged \texttt{CGAL.jl} to build the aforementioned
\textit{Geometric Constraint Primitives}, a set of functionalities that implements
specialized yet comprehensible constructive approach solutions to \ac{GC}
problems.
