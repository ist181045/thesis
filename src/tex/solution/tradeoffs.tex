\todo[inline]{Still not sure what to include here, but a section going over a
couple of issues circling the monstruous complexities of wrapping a gargantuan
library that CGAL proves to be a daunting task which, for simplicity's sake,
required hiding and pre-setting a lot of things on the C++ side of things.
Contrast this with the yet maturing Julia geometry ecosystem, which is proving
to be going somewhere, but it is still relatively young compared to things like
CGAL.  However, also illustrate that there are geometric Julia packages that
would be good candidates for replacing CGAL.

Additionally, explain why an approach using CxxWrap.jl was chosen, requiring an
explicit C++ wrapper library to hook into, which requires manual-ish compilation
and production, instead of using Cxx.jl, which can be used to inline C++ code
within Julia.  The former was chosen vs. the latter for what seemed like
stability reasons at the time.  The CxxWrap.jl approach seemed less complicated
despite the extra step of producing a C++ code shim that can then be fed into
CxxWrap.jl.}
