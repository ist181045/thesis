\subsubsection{Computational Geometry Algorithms Library}%
\label{sec:solution.impl.cgal}

\Ac{CGAL} is a library that provides easy access to efficient and reliable
geometric algorithms as a C++ library.  It is considered the industry's
\textit{de facto} standard geometric library.  We chose \ac{CGAL} because of its
comprehensiveness and decades of work.

\ac{CGAL} offers a multitude of data structures and algorithms, such as
triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, and convex hull algorithms, to name a few.
The library is broken up into three parts~\cite{CGAL:5.3:23LGK}:
\begin{enumerate*}
  \item The kernel, which consists of geometric primitive objects and operations
  on these objects,
  \item basic geometric data structures and algorithms, and
  \item non-geometric support facilities for debugging and for interfacing
  \ac{CGAL} with various visualization tools.
\end{enumerate*}

\Cref{lst:solution.impl.cgal.pas} showcases an example of a very simple
\ac{CGAL} program, demonstrating the construction of points and a segment, and
performing some basic operations on them.

It is worth noting that floating point-based computation can lead to surprising
results.  \Ac{CGAL} offers easily interchangeable kernels that provide
exact constructions, resolving this issue, albeit at a performance cost.

However, \ac{CGAL} is a terribly complex library under the hood, presenting many
challenges when it comes to mapping it to the Julia language.  For instance,
\ac{CGAL} makes heavy use of C++ templates, making it cumbersome to
transparently map functionality.

In the next section, we go over how we overcame said issues.
