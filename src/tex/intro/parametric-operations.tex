\subsection{Parametric Operations in CAD}%
\label{sec:intro.parametric}

Ivan Sutherland introduced the world to
Sketchpad~\cite{Sutherland:1964:Sketchpad} in 1963, an interactive 2D \ac{CAD}
program.  Sutherland's Sketchpad was capable of establishing atomic constraints
between objects which had all the essential properties of parametric equations,
being the first of its kind and the prime ancestor of modern \ac{CAD} programs.
The earliest 3D system~\cite{Requicha:1980:RRS:356827.356833} dates from the
1970s.  This system's parametric nature rested in a
\ac{CSG}~\cite{Requicha:1977:CSG,Foley:1996:CGPP} tree, which acted as a
rudimentary construction step history.  The user could modify an operation's
parameters' values, reapply the modified history, and generate the newly updated
model.  Nearly a decade later,
Pro/ENGINEER\footnote{\url{https://www.ptc.com/en/products/creo/pro-engineer}}~\cite{Jabi:2013:PDA}
surfaced.  It enabled the establishment of relations between the objects' sizes
and positions such that a change in a dimension between objects would
automatically change affected objects accordingly.  \Ac{GCS} soon became
standard in drawings by the early
1990s~\cite{Chung:1990:TEVPD,Owen:1991:ASGDC,Bouma:1995:GCS}.  Efforts to expand
the benefits of constraint solving beyond simple sketches were made, some
systems having implemented constraint solving in 3D.  Improvements from then on
focused mostly on robustness and operation variety.

In recent decades, emphasis shifted towards making parametric \ac{CAD} software
more interactive and user-friendly.  The intent was to make it as simple as
dragging a face of an object to where it should be instead of scrolling through
a construction history in attempts to locate an operation and changing the
correct parameter's value.  This is a tedious and error-prone process that can
lead to undesired side effects.  A variety of systems have been developed to
mitigate this rigidity~\cite{Samuel:2006:CPPUP,Wu:2007:MSMSM,Clarke:2009:SM},
but not without drawbacks.  Nonetheless, parametric operations will still see
continued usage for the foreseeable future.
