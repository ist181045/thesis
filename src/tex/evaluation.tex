\noindent In this chapter, we aim to evaluate our solution by measuring a few
qualities of the approach we took to tackle \ac{GCS} by deviating from a typical
generic solver-based approach by providing specialized solutions for a variety
of \ac{GC} problems.

Firstly, we aim to benchmark our solution's performance by comparing it to a
similar project called ConstraintGM~\cite{Pinheiro:2016:MGR}.  We were able to
reproduce the project's original benchmark tests and create an analogous test
suite for our solution so we can compare both projects.

Secondly, we explore our approach's potential regarding repurposing more complex
geometric algorithms in contrast with re-implementing a version of said
algorithms from scratch.  Specifically, we set out to repurpose \ac{CGAL}'s 2D
Delaunay Triangulation and Voronoi Diagram algorithms and further compare the
resulting mapping's performance and correctness when compared to a Julia
implementation of the algorithms in the form of
\texttt{VoronoiDelaunay.jl}~\cite{Keselman:2014:VoronoiDelaunay.jl}.  The latter
was once benchmarked against
\ac{CGAL}\footnote{\url{https://gist.github.com/skariel/3d2018f9341a058e00fc}}.
We aim to draw similar tests since then, the Julia language alone having matured
substantially over that span of time.  Additionally, we set out to estimate the
effort it took to develop \texttt{VoronoiDelaunay.jl} and compare that to the
effort it took to extract an analogous algorithm from \ac{CGAL}.

Finally, we end our evaluation by showcasing four different case studies
inspired by existing designs.  This section of the evaluation focuses on
comparing different approaches to solving \ac{GC} problems present in each case
study adopting two different approaches: an analytic approach, one programming
naturally begs for; and a constructive approach, essentially adding a conceptual
abstraction layer over the former.  We aim to show that, by following the latter
approach, resulting programs become both easier to understand and reproducible
as the set of instructions can be used to recreate the resulting geometry by
hand, using a ruler and a compass.

Benchmarks were performed on a Lenovo ThinkPad E595 laptop computer with the
following system specifications:

\begin{itemize}
  \acused{AMD}\label{acro:AMD}
  \acused{CPU}\label{acro:CPU}
  \item \ac{AMD} Ryzen\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} 5 3500U \ac{CPU} @
  2.1GHz\footnote{Base clock frequency.  Can boost up to 3.7GHz.};
  \acused{SO-DIMM}\label{acro:SO-DIMM}
  \acused{DDR}\label{acro:DDR}
  \acused{RAM}\label{acro:RAM}
  \item 1Ã—16GB \ac{SO-DIMM} of \ac{DDR}4 \ac{RAM} @ 2400MT/s\footnote{\emph{Not}
  \textbf{M}ega\textbf{H}ert\textbf{z} (MHz).  \textbf{T}ransfers per
  \textbf{s}econd (T/s) depend on the memory's data rate.  \acf{DDR} memory can
  transfer twice the data per clock cycle, which means, at 2400MT/s, the
  respective \ac{DDR} memory's clock frequency would be 1200MHz.}.

\section{VoronoiDelaunay.jl}%
\label{sec:eval.vdjl}

% \todo[inline]{Maybe leave the "how easy it is to leverage our approach to get
% more, both in quantity and complexity, algorithsm from CGAL" discussion for this
% part and evaluate the potential time it takes to use Voronoi Diagrams from CGAL
% and either get more information on how long it took to implement
% VoronoiDelaunay.jl and compare its "correctness" vs. CGAL's version of the
% algorithm, assuming CGAL's results as a source of truth for correctness.
% Testing revealed diagrams differed slightly when it came to some edges.  My
% suspicion was the Julia algorithm "gobble" some very very very small triangles,
% i.e., where the edges are very close together, but it only happens near the
% outside of the diagram, and, again, a more drastic diagram can be manufactured
% to showcase this.  Maybe read up more on the underlying algorithm that was
% implemented in VoronoiDelaunay.jl}
