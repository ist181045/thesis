\section{Evaluation}%
\label{sec:eval}

In this section, we evaluate our solution by measuring the qualities of the
approach we took to tackle \ac{GCS}.

Firstly, we benchmark our solution's performance by comparing it to a
similar project called ConstraintGM~\cite{Pinheiro:2016:MGR}.

Secondly, we showcase two different case studies, focusing on solving \ac{GC}
problems by adopting two different approaches: 
\begin{enumerate*}[label= (\arabic*)]
  \item an analytic approach, one programming naturally begs for, and 
  \item a constructive approach, adding an abstraction over the former.
\end{enumerate*}
We aim to show the latter produces programs that are both easier to understand
and to reproduce.

Finally, we explore our approach's potential for obtaining more complex
geometric algorithms vs.\ re-implementing a version of said algorithms from
scratch.  Specifically, we repurpose \ac{CGAL}'s 2D Delaunay Triangulation and
Voronoi Diagram algorithms, comparing them to a Julia implementation of the
algorithms provided by the
\texttt{VoronoiDelaunay.jl}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/VoronoiDelaunay.jl}},
package.  Additionally, we estimate the effort it took to extract the algorithms
from \ac{CGAL} and compare it to the effort it took to develop the ones in
\texttt{VoronoiDelaunay.jl}.

Benchmarks were performed on a Lenovo{\textregistered}
ThinkPad{\textregistered} E595 laptop computer with the following
system specifications:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \acsu{AMD}\label{acro:AMD} Ryzen\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} 5 3500U
  \acsu{CPU}\label{acro:CPU} @ 2.1GHz\footnote{Base clock frequency.  Can boost
  up to 3.7GHz.};
  \item 1Ã—16GB \acsu{SO-DIMM}\label{acro:SO-DIMM} of \acsu{DDR}\label{acro:DDR}4
  \acsu{RAM}\label{acro:RAM} @ 2400MT/s.
  \item Arch
