\section{Solution}%
\label{sec:solution}

Despite strides in enhancing performance and efficiency of geometric constraint
solving approaches, the core issue lies in the generality of geometric
constraint solvers.  Instead of delegating the problem to a solver, a more
efficient approach would be to provide a specialized solution for said problem.

This work aims to implement a series of geometric constraint primitives in an
already expressive \ac{TPL} to overcome the need for the specification of
unnecessary details when modeling geometrically constrained entities.  Choosing
to implement these in a \ac{TPL} further avoids \acp{VPL}' poor scalability with
increasing code complexity.

Moreover, by relying on an exact geometry computation library, one of the core
features of this solution lies in the capability of transparently dealing with
robustness issues.  The user can then resort to the implemented primitives, and,
by composing them, elegantly specify the set of geometric constraints necessary
to produce the idealized model.

\Cref{fig:solution.arch} shows the typical \ac{AD} workflow and how the proposed
solution could be integrated with the \ac{AD} tool.  The encapsulated modules in
the figure represent our solution's components.
