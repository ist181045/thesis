In this section, we discuss numerical accuracy issues that arise when performing
computations with fixed-precision arithmetic.  We then proceed to naming some
precautions and highlighting alternative methods of obtaining practical
solutions.

That is followed by a comparative analysis of a set of \ac{GCS}-capable
programming tools along different dimensions, such as supported language
paradigm, native \ac{GCS} capabilities, 2D and 3D support.

Similarly, we analyze a variety of \ac{AD} tools.  Some of them are integrated
within \ac{CAD} applications while others are standalone applications.  These
tools and their capabilities are summarized in \cref{tab:related.ad.summary}.

The section closes with small remarks on \acp{VPL}' poorer scalability with
increasing project complexity when compared to \acp{TPL}, showcasing the
\ac{RGC} as an example.
