\noindent
In this chapter, we expose and discuss numerical accuracy issues that arise when
performing computations with fixed-precision arithmetic.  We then proceed to
naming some precautions and steps in order to obtain practical solutions,
followed by a brief mention of some software libraries dedicated to overcoming
these issues through a series of exact algorithms and data structures.

We follow that by a comparative analysis of a set of \ac{GCS}-capable
programming tools along different dimensions, such as supported language
paradigm, native \ac{GCS} capabilities, 2D and 3D support.  Of those tools,
Eukleides, GeoSolver, and \acs{TikZ} \& \acs{PGF} are extensively discussed.

Similarly, we analyze \ac{AD} tools.  Some of them are integrated within
\ac{CAD} applications while others are standalone applications.  These tools and
their capabilities are summarized in \cref{tab:related.ad.summary}.
Furthermore, Dynamo and Grasshopper are expanded upon.

The chapter closes with small remarks on \acp{VPL}' poorer scalability with
increasing project complexity when compared to \acp{TPL}, showcasing the
\ac{RGC} as an example.
