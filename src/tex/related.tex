\noindent
In this chapter, we start by exposing and discussing numerical accuracy issues
that arise when performing computations with fixed-precision arithmetic in
\cref{sec:related.robustness}.  We then proceed to naming some precautions and
steps in order to obtain practical solutions, followed by a brief mention of
some software libraries dedicated to overcoming these issues.  To that end, said
libraries provide a series of exact algorithms and data structures.

Secondly, we comparatively analyze a set of \ac{GCS}-capable programming tools'
qualities, such as supported language paradigm, native \ac{GCS} capabilities, 2D
and 3D support; summarized in \cref{tab:related.constraints.summary}.  Of those
tools, Eukleides, GeoSolver, and \acs{TikZ} \& \acs{PGF} are extensively
discussed.

Finally, we similarly analyze \ac{AD} tools.  Some of them are integrated within
\ac{CAD} applications while a few of them are standalone applications.  These
tools and their capabilities are summarized in \cref{tab:related.ad.summary}.
Furthermore, Dynamo and Grasshopper are expanded upon.
