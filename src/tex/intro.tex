\noindent
Modern \ac{CAD} applications include substantial support for parametric
operations and \ac{GCS}.  These mechanisms have been developed over the past few
decades~\cite{Bettig:2011:GCSPC} and are heavily and ubiquitously used across
the \ac{AEC} industry.

Parametric modeling is used to design with constraints, whereby users express a
set of parameters and interdependent operations, establishing restrictions
between geometric entities.  The resulting geometry can be controlled from input
parameters using two computational mechanisms:
\begin{enumerate*}[label= (\arabic*)]
  \item parametric operations, which build geometry that implicitly abides by
  constraints imposed when the user selects the operation and its inputs, and
  \item \ac{GCS}, which manipulates geometry in sketches and models to satisfy
  constraints explicitly imposed on objects by the user.
\end{enumerate*}

Nowadays, Parametric operations in \ac{CAD} software are mostly accessible
through intuitive, robust, and easy to use direct-manipulation interfaces,
offering a wide variety of different operations.  These operations are created
when a designer uses solid modeling operations, such as face extrusions or shape
unions; and recorded into a user-controlled sequential history of construction
steps that can be replayed in the face of changes, updating the modeled
geometry.  Alas, dependency propagation direction is fixed, forcing users to
plan their model's features beforehand.  In constraint solving, by contrast,
dependency propagation direction isn't fixed.  Instead, users introduce a set of
parameters and geometric entities followed by specifying the constraints that
relate these objects.  Naturally, \ac{GCS} fits in \ac{CAD} software, having
been target of considerable research and development to implement efficient
approaches and methodologies capable of solving \ac{GC} problems.  So much so
that it has become standard in major \ac{CAD} software, such as
AutoCAD~\cite{Autodesk:1982:AutoCAD}, which supports the ability to constrain
objects in a variety of ways, e.g., point coincidence, line perpendicularity,
tangencies, among other kinds of constraints.

However, traditional interactive methods for parametric modeling suffer from the
disadvantage that they do not scale properly when designing more complex ideas.
In recent years, a novel approach to design named \ac{AD} has emerged,
introducing the algorithmic methodology also present in the \ac{CS} field,
allowing the specification of sketches and models through
algorithms~\cite{McCormack:2004:GDPDR}, leading to the creation and integration
of several \ac{AD} tools into \ac{CAD} software as well.  Some use \acp{VPL},
others \acp{TPL}, or even a mixture of both.  The latter overcomes a fundamental
issue with \acp{VPL} which is the frequently disproportionate complexity between
the program and the respective resulting model.

\acp{TPL} come with some advantages over \acp{VPL}, among which are
\begin{enumerate*}[label= (\arabic*)]
  \item abstraction mechanisms, enabling the encapsulation of behavior that can
  be changed and reused in a different context at a later time,
  \item the ability of specifying recursive definitions,
  \item resulting source code can be put under a version control system, and
  \item multiple developers can work on the same codebase.
\end{enumerate*}
In spite of these, dealing with \acp{GC} remains an arduous task.  Take as an
example the sketch of a chair seat's outer frame, as seen in
\cref{fig:intro.chair}, from a multi-purpose chair generation
tool~\cite{Garcia:2012:ChairDNA} where the chair's overall shape is controllable
by specifying the values for a set of input parameters.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \caption[Sketch of a chair seat's outer frame]{
    Sketch of a chair seat's outer frame, defined by 5 input parameters:
    \begin{enumerate*}[label= (\arabic*)]
      \item Width ($g-w$),
      \item depth ($g-d$),
      \item taper width ($g-\Delta wt$),
      \item front radius ($g-rf$), and
      \item rear radius ($g-rr$).
    \end{enumerate*}}%
  \label{fig:intro.chair}
\end{figure}

The seat's corners are defined by circles whose respective front and rear
radius' length, $g-rf,g-rr$, is obtained by computing distances, from which the
circles' centers, $GFC$ and $GBC$, can be obtained.  The circles are then
connected through outer tangent lines, $gsl$, forming the outer frame of the
chair's seat.  Some of these operations, such as the radius computation,
\textit{tangency}, and \textit{circumcenter}, depend on operations that query if
a point is at a certain distance from an object, or if two points are
coincident.  Such operations must be handled carefully due to numerical
robustness issues that may arise when performing fixed-precision arithmetic.  As
such, on top of the design process itself, the user must identify these kinds of
\acp{GC}, resorting to trigonometry analysis, perform tolerance-based
comparisons to determine point distance or if two points are coincident, among
other techniques the user most likely is not aware he must rely upon to
circumvent these issues, particularly, when we take into consideration that most
designers using \ac{AD} are architects and designers without an extensive
background in \ac{CS}.

To overcome the limitations exposed above, this report proposes the
implementation of a wide variety of \ac{GC} primitives with
specialized efficient solutions for different combinations of input objects.  In
this manner, the user won't have to be aware of numerical robustness issues and
have to investigate techniques for solving such issues to accurately generate a
model riddled with \acp{GC}.
