Modern \ac{CAD} tools include substantial support for parametric operations and
\ac{GCS}.  These mechanisms have been developed over the past few
decades~\cite{Bettig:2011:GCSPC} and are heavily and ubiquitously used across
the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction industry.

Parametric modeling is used to design with constraints, whereby users express a
set of parameters and interdependent operations, establishing restrictions
between geometric entities.  The resulting geometry can be controlled from input
parameters using two computational mechanisms:
\begin{enumerate*}[label= (\arabic*)]
  \item parametric operations, which build geometry that implicitly abides by
  constraints imposed when the user selects the operation and its inputs, and
  \item \ac{GCS}, which finds the positions of geometric entities that satisfy a
  set of constraints explicitly imposed by the user.
\end{enumerate*}

Nowadays, parametric operations in \ac{CAD} software are mostly accessible
through intuitive, robust, and easy-to-use direct-manipulation interfaces,
offering a wide variety of different operations.  These operations are created
when a designer uses solid modeling operations, such as face extrusions or shape
unions; and recorded into a user-controlled sequential history of construction
steps that can be replayed in the event of changes, updating the modeled
geometry.  Alas, dependency propagation direction is fixed, forcing users to
plan their model's features beforehand.  In constraint solving, by contrast,
dependency propagation direction isn't fixed.  Instead, users introduce a set of
parameters and geometric entities followed by specifying the constraints that
relate these objects.  Naturally, \ac{GCS} fits in \ac{CAD} software, having
been the target of considerable research and development to implement efficient
approaches and methodologies capable of solving \ac{GC} problems.  So much so
that it has become standard in major \ac{CAD} software, such as
AutoCAD\footnote{https://autodesk.com/autocad} from
Autodesk\textsuperscript\textregistered, which supports the ability to constrain
objects in a variety of ways, e.g., point coincidence, line perpendicularity,
and tangencies, among other kinds of constraints.

However, traditional interactive methods for parametric modeling suffer from the
disadvantage that they do not scale properly when designing more complex ideas.
In recent years, a novel approach to design named \ac{AD} has emerged, allowing
the specification of sketches and models through
algorithms~\cite{McCormack:2004:GDPDR}, leading to the creation and integration
of \ac{AD} tools into \ac{CAD} software as well.  Some use \acp{VPL},
others \acp{TPL}, or even a mixture of both.  The latter overcomes a fundamental
issue with \acp{VPL} which is the frequently disproportionate complexity between
the program and the respective resulting model.

Dealing with \acp{GC}, regardless of the approach, can still prove to be an
arduous task.  Take as an example the sketch of a chair seat's outer frame, as
seen in \cref{fig:intro.chair}, from a multi-purpose chair generation
tool~\cite{Garcia:2012:ChairDNA} where the chair's overall shape is controllable
by specifying the values for a set of input parameters.

  \caption[Sketch of a chair seat's outer frame]{
    Sketch of a chair seat's outer frame, defined by 5 input parameters:
    \begin{enumerate*}[label= (\arabic*)]
      \item Width \texttt{g-w},
      \item depth \texttt{g-d},
      \item taper width \texttt{g-$\Delta$wt},
      \item front radius \texttt{g-rf}, and
      \item rear radius \texttt{g-rr}.
    \end{enumerate*}}%
  \label{fig:intro.chair}
\end{figure}

The seat's corners are defined by circles whose respective front and rear
radius' length, \texttt{g-rf}, \texttt{g-rr}, is obtained by computing
distances, from which the circles' centers, \texttt{GFC} and \texttt{GBC}, can
be obtained.  The circles are then connected through outer tangent lines,
\texttt{gsl}, forming the outer frame of the chair's seat.  Some of these
operations, such as the radius computation, \textit{tangency}, and
\textit{circumcenter}, depend on operations that query if a point is at a
certain distance from an object, or if two points are coincident.  Such
operations must be handled carefully due to numerical robustness issues that may
arise when performing fixed-precision arithmetic.  As such, on top of the design
process itself, the user must identify the \acp{GC}, resorting to trigonometry
analysis, perform tolerance-based comparisons to determine point distance or if
two points are coincident, among other techniques the user most likely is not
aware he must rely upon to circumvent these issues, particularly, when we take
into consideration that most \ac{AD} practitioners are architects and designers
without an extensive background in \ac{CS}.

To overcome the limitations exposed above, this report proposes the
implementation of \ac{GC} primitives with specialized efficient solutions for
different combinations of input objects.  We additionally focus our work around
\acp{TPL}, further making them more attractive, and easier to both adopt and
use.
