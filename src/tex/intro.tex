\section{Introduction}%
\label{sec:intro}

Modern \ac{CAD} tools include substantial support for parametric operations and
\ac{GCS}.  These mechanisms have been developed over the past few
decades~\cite{Bettig:2011:GCSPC} and are heavily and ubiquitously used across
the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction industry.

Parametric modeling is used to design with constraints.  Users express a set of
parameters and operations, establishing restrictions between geometric entities.
The resulting geometry can be controlled from input parameters using two
computational mechanisms:
\begin{enumerate*}[label= (\arabic*)]
  \item parametric operations, and
  \item \ac{GCS}.
\end{enumerate*}

However, traditional interactive methods for parametric modeling suffer from the
disadvantage that they do not scale properly when designing more complex ideas.
In recent years, a novel approach to design named \ac{AD} has emerged, allowing
the specification of sketches and models through
algorithms~\cite{McCormack:2004:GDPDR} using either a \ac{TPL}, a \acp{VPL}, or
even a mixture of both.

Dealing with \acp{GC} can still prove to be an arduous task.  Take as an example
the sketch of a chair seat's outer frame, as seen in \cref{fig:intro.chair},
from a multi-purpose chair generation tool~\cite{Garcia:2012:ChairDNA} where the
chair's overall shape is controllable by specifying the values for a set of
input parameters.

  \caption[Sketch of a chair seat's outer frame]{\label{fig:intro.chair}
    Sketch of a chair seat's outer frame, defined by several input parameters.}
\end{figure}

The seat's corners are defined by circles whose respective front and rear radii
are obtained by computing distances from which the circles' centers can be
obtained.  The circles are then connected through outer tangent lines, forming
the outer frame of the chair's seat.  Some of these operations, such as point
distance and tangency, must be handled carefully due to numerical robustness
issues that may arise when performing fixed-precision arithmetic computations.
This means that, on top of the design process itself, the user must spend
additional time identifying and carefully researching how to robustly implement
solutions to \acp{GC}.

To overcome this problem, this report proposes the implementation of \ac{GC}
primitives with specialized efficient solutions for different combinations of
input objects.  We additionally focus our work around \acp{TPL}, further making
them more attractive, and easier to both adopt and use.
