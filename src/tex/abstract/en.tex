Modern \acl{CAD} applications need to employ, to a lesser or greater extent,
geometric constraints that condition the geometric models being produced.  As an
example, consider that of a line that goes through a point and is parallel to
another line, or constructing a circle from three points.  The specification
(and solving) of geometric constraints allows the creation of geometric shapes
that, otherwise, would require substantially more complex descriptions.  The
inclusion, in a programming language, of primitive operations for creating
geometric constraints augments the expressiveness of the language and frees the
programmer from the specification of otherwise apparently irrelevant details.
Said primitive operations could include the definition of incidence relations,
parallelism or perpendicularity, distances, angles, etc., to which the various
parts in a geometric model must obey.  The focus of this work is the creation
and implementation, of geometric constraint primitives that facilitate the
specification of geometric forms.
