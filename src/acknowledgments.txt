I am terribly grateful for anyone and everyone who supported me throughout this
journey, in whatever competence.

First and foremost, to my dear supervisor, António Leitão, without whom this
dissertation would not exist.  Thank you for your guidance, insight, support,
and friendship, which was sorely needed during such a turbulent travel.

Secondly, I would like to extend my gratitude to everyone in the Algorithmic
Design for Architecture (ADA) group.  Special mention to members Sara Garcia
and Renata Castelo-Branco.  Thank you both for additional support and your
friendship as well.

Additionally, thank you to all my friends and family who have also offered me
support and incentivized me to get finish this thesis.  Sorry for being so numb
and taking so long.  Thank you.

Finally, to my parents.  Thank you.  Truly.  For everything: your love, your
care, your support, and much much more.  Despite not being the most cooperative
person, they still put up with me, through thick and thin.  Even though it is a
cliché, there really are no words I can use to express my gratitude to you both.
I am sorry, but thankful.
